## CALL FOR PAPERS AND CATALYTIC INTERFACE PROPOSALS

We are pleased to announce that CAAD Futures 2025 will be held at the University of Hong Kong during the first week of July 2025. 
 
The theme of CAAD Futures 2025 is 'Catalytic Interfacesâ€™. This reflects our goals (i) to catalyse collaborative and interdisciplinary research initiatives around emergent computer-aided architectural design (CAAD) research priorities, and (ii) to provide a platform for local, regional, and international researchers in the field of CAAD to interface and collaborate. 
 
To achieve this, we have designed a dynamic <mark>two-pronged programme</mark>. Our conference features <mark>Regular Paper Presentations</mark>. on emergent interfacing CAAD research. Additionally, a dedicated series of team-based <mark>'Catalytic Interface' programming</mark> will provide infrastructure, both physical and digital, along with focused time and attention for fostering collaboration on new research priorities both during and prior to the conference.
