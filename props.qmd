### Team Participation in ‘Catalytic Interfaces’
 
We invite researchers to take advantage of the special ‘Catalytic Interface’ programming. Interested researchers are asked to form teams around a core expertise, and develop ideas for interdisciplinary research that interface with one or multiple CAAD topic areas. Dedicated ‘Catalytic Interface’ programming and infrastructure both before and during the conference will offer a platform for selected teams to collaborate with like-minded teams with relevant expertise, catalysing initial discussions as well as the prototyping of ideas during the conference. 
 
Specifically, the process begins with team formation and the submission of project proposals by `30 September 2024`. Overall, the ‘Catalytic Interfaces’ process entails: 
 
- Proposal Submission: Each team, centred around a core expertise, will submit a proposal by 30 September 2024 (see below for instructions).  Proposals are encouraged to outline collaboration ideas that explore new research interfaces across one or multiple CAAD topic areas beyond the team’s existing expertise. 
 
- Team Selection: A peer review process will select promising proposals. 
 
- Team Dialogue:  Selected teams will review each other’s work, initiating dialogue based on shared interests. A series of online catalyser events in early 2025 will foster productive team pairings around emergent CAAD research priorities.  
 
- Position Paper Submission: Team pairs/groupings will then submit a Position Paper, which will undergo a peer review process.   
 
- Publication of Position Papers: Position Papers will be published through the conference’s companion publication ahead of the conference. 
 
- Conference Prototyping and Presentation: During the three-day conference, team pairs will prototype their ideas, culminating in public presentations at the end of the event. 
 
- <mark>Expert Invitation Awards</mark>: From the final selection of projects, CAAD Futures 2025 will offer up to eight Expert Invitation Awards to support travel expenses for an expert team member or their expert invitee, aiming to enhance impactful collaboration and outcomes. Awardees will have the opportunity to chair a panel session or speaker-driven paper session. 
 
Proposal submissions shall include the following items: 

a. A succinct and descriptive title; 
b. List of team members with a 100-word biography for each member; 
c. The CAAD area(s) related to the team’s core expertise and interests; and 
d. Identified CAAD areas where the team seeks collaboration via ‘Catalytic Interfaces’; 
e. A Statement of Interest of no longer than 1000 words (excluding references) that clearly describes a research question or thesis that the team wishes to develop through ‘Catalytic Interfaces’, synthesising CAAD areas in point c and d, and outlining the potential benefits and anticipated impact of this synthesis on architecture. 
f. Up to 5 nominees for the Expert Invitation Award (in order of preference), which may include either team members or external invitees.
 
<mark>Our submission system is now open.  Please submit your ‘Catalytic Interfaces’ proposal via EasyChair [here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=caadfutures2025) by `30 September 2024`.  Be sure to select the option “‘Catalytic Interfaces’ Proposal” under the field “Submission Type.” </mark>
