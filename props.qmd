The theme of CAAD Futures 2025 is 'Catalytic Interfaces’. This reflects our goals (i) to catalyse collaborative and interdisciplinary research initiatives around emergent computer-aided architectural design (CAAD) research priorities, and (ii) to provide a platform for local, regional, and international researchers in the field of CAAD to interface and collaborate. 
 
To achieve this, we have designed a dynamic <mark>two-pronged programme</mark>. Our conference features <mark>Regular Paper Presentations</mark>. on emergent interfacing CAAD research. Additionally, a dedicated series of team-based <mark>'Catalytic Interface' programming</mark> will provide infrastructure, both physical and digital, along with focused time and attention for fostering collaboration on new research priorities both during and prior to the conference. 
 
You are receiving this email because we recognise you as a research catalyser in the field of CAAD research. We invite you to participate in our conference through one or both of the two programmes mentioned above: 
 

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Team Participation in 'Catalytic Interfaces'</h4>
 
We invite researchers to take advantage of the special ‘Catalytic Interface’ programming.  Interested researchers are asked to form teams around a core expertise, and develop ideas for interdisciplinary research that interface with one or multiple CAAD topic areas.  Dedicated ‘Catalytic Interface’ programming and infrastructure both before and during the conference will offer a platform for selected teams to collaborate with like-minded teams with relevant expertise, catalysing initial discussions as well as the prototyping of ideas during the conference.   
 
Specifically, the process begins with team formation and submission of Initial Statement of Interest by `16 September 2024`.   

<mark>We are still actively working to set up the submission system. Please revisit in early September for updates, and we appreciate your enthusiasm and patience in the meantime.</mark>
 
Statements are peer-reviewed and promising statements and teams are then selected.  Next, a series of online catalyser events are held to foster productive team pairs/groupings around emergent CAAD priorities synthesising their interests.  Team pairs/groupings will then submit Proposals that set the stage for their collaboration during the three-day conference to prototype their ideas. Ultimately, these efforts will culminate in the publication of peer-reviewed proposals through the conference’s companion publication, as well as public presentations at the end of the conference.  See [A1](conference_theme.qmd) for additional details on the special programming and [A3](20240809_Timeline_WIP.pdf) for a tentative timeline of both programme and the submission process. 
 
Submissions shall include the following items: 

a. A succinct and descriptive title;  
b. List of team members with a 100-word biography for each member; 
c. The CAAD area(s) related to the team’s core expertise and interests; and  
d. Identified CAAD areas where the team seeks collaboration via ‘Catalytic Interfaces’; 
e. A Statement of Interest of no longer than 1000 words that clearly describes a research question or thesis that the team wishes to develop through ‘Catalytic Interfaces’, synthesising CAAD areas in c and d, and outlining the potential benefits and anticipated impact of this synthesis on architecture. 

From the final selection of projects, up to eight projects will be awarded an <mark>“Expert Invitation Award”</mark> to support travel expenses of an Expert Team Member or their Expert Invitee. This person will be given the opportunity to chair a panel session or speaker-driven paper session, which aims to enhance the potential for impactful collaboration and output.
