We invite researchers to submit abstracts by `16 September 2024`.  

<mark>We are still actively working to set up the submission system. Please revisit in early September for updates, and we appreciate your enthusiasm and patience in the meantime.</mark>
 
Abstracts should be of no longer than 250 words.  The submission process includes initial abstract submission and acceptance upon peer review, followed additionally by one to two peer review rounds.  Abstract decisions will be announced by 28 October 2024; paper decisions for the two revision rounds will be announced by 17 February 2025 and 7 April 2025, respectively.  Please note that all dates are tentative.   
 
High-quality submissions will be selected for publication by the end of the first review round either as (A) long papers in a Springer publication or as (B) short papers in a companion conference publication. The selection for these categories will be based on both quality as well as the curation of the conference programme. We especially welcome research papers pioneering novel CAAD paradigm interfacing multiple CAAD technologies.    See [A2](topics.qmd) for a list of potential paper topics and [A3](20240809_Timeline_WIP.pdf) for a tentative timeline of the submission process.
